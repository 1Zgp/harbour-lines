![icon](icons/86x86/harbour-lines.png)

Classic puzzle game. Three color balls are randomly placed on the game board at every round. You have to select one ball by clicking on it and move it to a different location (click on the target square).  Horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines of 5 or more balls of the same color are eliminated, adding to the score and giving you additional move before the next three balls appear on the board. The longer the lines are the more points you earn.
